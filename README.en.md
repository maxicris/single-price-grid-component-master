Welcome. How you doing? :wave:

This challenge is to build out this feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
To do it, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. :white_check_mark:

Here you can see the [Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/single-price-grid-component-5ce41129d0ff452fec5abbbc/).

And here the [Demo](https://maxicris.github.io/single-price-grid-component-master/).

There are many more challenges in [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) that allow you to improve skills in a real life workflow. :fire:

Thanks for watch!  :green_heart:
